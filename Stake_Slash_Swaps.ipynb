        "**Stake Slash Swap (SSS)** was designed by Hypersphere to allow seamless transfer of slashing risk between two parties by a financial instrument. The design is borrowed from a credit default swap (CDS) widely used in the credit market. Like CDSs in the traditional finance market, the contract facilitates the exchange of expected value of the tokens exchanged in the event of slash with a present value of periodic cash flow. This results in a two party exchanging, or **swapping**, two stream of equally valuable cash.\n"

        "Feedback: Does the Stake Slash Swap incentivize validators to behave badly? \\\n",
        ">Hypersphere have heard some concerns that a bad actor can purchase Stake Slash Swaps to protect themselves before a malicious attack; thus, the existence of SSSs can protect and incentivize potential bad actors. While this risk is real, Hypersphere views the SSS to be an early indicator of a bad actor and not an incentive. If a bad actor purchases a large number of SSS on a particular validator before an attack, the bad actor is attracting attention to that particular validator by increasing the value of the swap, expressed as the SSS Spread, compared to other validators. Furthermore, majority of validators are operated by staking providers, who have their reputations irreparably damaged when a slashing event occurs. Unless the staking provider can aggregate a massive SSS position in a single validator, the business risk posed by slashing event will be greater than financial incentive for the stake provider. Finally, the swap also serves as a benefit to new stakers, as it can see the validator specific SSS Spread to evaluate the riskiness of each validator or staking provider that owns sets of validators; thus, allowing the community to help in the due diligence process."
